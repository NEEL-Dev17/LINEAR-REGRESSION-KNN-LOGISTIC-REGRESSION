## 📊 Introduction
This repository contains Python implementations of three fundamental machine learning algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

## ✨ Features
- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous outcomes using linear relationships.
- **KNN**: Classify or predict based on the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classify binary outcomes using logistic functions.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data and model performance using `matplotlib`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error.

## 🛠 Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
